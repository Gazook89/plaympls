We are asking that anyone who sees value in more playgrounds, rather than fewer, to reach out to the key decision makers and city leaders with respectful letters of support-- support for playgrounds, parks, strong communities, and strong kids.  

Below is a list of contacts, predominantly for those in government such as with Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), Minneapolis Parks & Recreation Board (MPRB), and City Hall.  The list does *not* include other stakeholders-- please talk with your neighbors, educators, and anyone else who might have an interest in expanding access to playgrounds.
