We are asking that anyone who sees value in more playgrounds, rather than fewer, to reach out to the key decision makers and city leaders with respectful letters of support-- support for playgrounds, parks, strong communities, and strong kids.  

Below is a list of contacts, predominantly for those in government such as with Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), Minneapolis Parks & Recreation Board (MPRB), and City Hall.  The list does *not* include other stakeholders-- please talk with your neighbors, educators, and anyone else who might have an interest in expanding access to playgrounds.

## Minneapolis Parks & Rec (MPRB)

MPRB hosts a twice-monthly regular meeting of their board on Wednesday nights, the first and third of the month (and it *can* meet on the second Wednesday as well), at 5pm at the Mary Merrill Headquarters near Broadway Ave and West River Road ([2117 West River Road N Minneapolis](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Minneapolis+Park+and+Recreation+Board+Headquarters,+2117+West+River+Rd+N,+Minneapolis,+MN+55411/@45.0008054,-93.3603075,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x52b3326f4746385b:0xd462c4fe5b2fa5cc!2m2!1d-93.2779069!2d45.000835?entry=ttu)).  

**At each meeting, at 5:30pm, the floor opens to public comment on any topic, 2 minutes for each speaker and total time not exceeding 15 minutes** (allotted time is not guaranteed, and can be between 30 seconds to 3 minutes).  Sign up to speak by either calling <a href="tel:612-230-6400">612-230-6400</a> before 3pm the same day, or signing up at the front desk before the meeting (time limited).  Alternatively, submit a question/comment in writing to <a href="mailto:OpenTime@minneapolisparks.org">OpenTime@minneapolisparks.org</a> by noon the same day.  You do not have to stick around to hear the rest of the board meeting after public comments, and typically it's not a very large crowd.  If you want to watch from afar, the meetings are live-streamed on the [MPRB youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MinneapolisParks/streams).
