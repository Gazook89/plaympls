PlayMPLS is a small grassroots group of parents thinking about the future of the Cooper Elementary playground and surrounding fields, as well as the future of all Minneapolis Public Schools outdoor play areas.  Preservation through rehabilitation, or well-considered replacement if needed, can help keep the Cooper playground community gathering place for kids, teens, and parents for years to come.
